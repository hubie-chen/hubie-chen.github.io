hosted by Hubie Chen and will be expected to work on topics related to
the themes of complexity, database theory, structural decomposition
methods, and logic. Research interest and experience in the following
areas will be valued: logic in computer science, database theory, finite
model theory, structural decomposition methods, term rewriting, and
parameterized complexity theory.</p>
<p>Key dates: the application deadline is June 6, 2024; it is hoped that
the successful applicant will start in or around October 2024, but there
